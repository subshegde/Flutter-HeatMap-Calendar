# 🚀 Interactive Heatmaps with Flutter

I’m excited to share a recent project where I implemented an **interactive heatmap visualization** using **Flutter**! 🎉

In this project, I created a **heatmap calendar** that displays yearly data in an interactive way. The data is represented using a static map of `DateTime` and `int`, and the heatmap dynamically adjusts based on the selected year. 🗓️

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Heatmap Generation**: Displays heatmaps for different years based on sample data.
- **Yearly Data Classification**: Data is color-coded into **"Good"**, **"Better"**, and **"Best"** categories based on average values.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can easily toggle between different years and see real-time changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## 📊 Technologies Used

This project leverages the **`flutter_heatmap_calendar`** package to visualize the data and provide an intuitive calendar view. It enables users to easily understand trends and patterns over time.

## 🎯 Features

- Select different years to view corresponding data on a heatmap.
- View color-coded yearly classifications: **Good**, **Better**, and **Best** based on the average value.
- Tap on any date to get more detailed information about that date's data.
- **Responsive**: Optimized for mobile screens of all sizes.
